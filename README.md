# Zinc-Million
Millions of small molecules will be downloaded from the ZINC database in 3D SDF format for docking-based virtual screening purposes. 

### Option 1: Click on the badge and select Run All to execute the notebook on Google Colab (Coloab account needed)

##### A warning to Binder users, you should download the result in the time since the virtual environment is temporary.

The downloading process would take about 20-30 minutes to finish, generating a file about 4GB. But these estimations are just estimations, they vary at different times since the database is updating all the time.
